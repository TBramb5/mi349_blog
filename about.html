    <p>Welcome to The Great Apes Blog. This site is run by one man named Timothy, a 24 year old college student who is passionate about 
    great apes. I started this blog as part of a school project in my senior year at university. Ever since I was a kid, visiting the 
    zoo sparked my interest in wildlife, especially apes. Their intelligence, behavior, and close connection to humans make them some 
    of the coolest creatures on Earth. I want to share interesting facts, conservation stories, and my personal enthusiasm with you. 
    Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy learning about the fascinating world of great apes.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m currently a senior at Michigan State University, pursuing a degree in Interactive Games and Media. I love blending creativity 
    and technology to bring stories and experiences to life. Every project is a chance to explore new ideas and challenge myself to think 
    outside the box. This summer, I am taking a course called MI349, Web Design and Development, which inspired me to create this website 
    and taught me how to code in HTML. Balancing school and my love for great apes keeps life exciting and full of inspiration every day.</p>
